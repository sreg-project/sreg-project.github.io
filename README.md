# sreg project website

Website: https://sreg-project.github.io/

Documentation for estimation and inference in stratified randomized experiments, with R, Stata, and Python implementations.

## Edit and publish

The editable pages and assets are in `source/`; the shared layout is in `overrides/`. The site is built with Zensical. GitHub Pages publishes the generated `docs/` directory on the `main` branch.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/zensical build --strict
python3 check_site.py
touch docs/.nojekyll
```

Commit both the source changes and updated `docs/`, then push to `main`. GitHub Pages automatically publishes the updated files. For a local preview, run `.venv/bin/zensical serve`.

## Contents

- Introductory walkthrough for R, Stata, and Python
- Detailed R guide and reference
- Empirical application using the Peru encouragement experiment
- Supported experimental designs and methodological references
- Companion paper section, awaiting the manuscript
